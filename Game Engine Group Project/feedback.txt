How to play:

move around with wasd and space fly and left click shoot

Feedback:
The flying feels nice and fuild, movemnt didnt feel constricted. shooting was accuirte to where cursor was.

sometimes it felt like the player character would do stuff on its own eg flew stright up without button being pressed.


FEEDBACK: INCREASE DIFFICULTY WHEN YOU FLY UP HIGHER
